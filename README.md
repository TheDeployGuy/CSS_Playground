# CSS Playground

This is my CSS playground for re-learning and messing around with CSS concepts. This is also a place for me to keep notes.

Div:
    Default for divs is to take 100% of its container minus padding/margin in Box model.
    When you give a size in percentage it is of its container
    Margin/Padding order = T R B L (Clockwise)
    As long as you have a <div> with a certain width you can use auto to center a div horizontalally.
